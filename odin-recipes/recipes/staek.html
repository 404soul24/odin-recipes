    <h1>Steak Recipe</h1>
    <img src=" /img/steak.jpg" alt="tajine" width="1500" height="1000">
    <p>Steak is humanity’s primal flex—just a hunk of cow, cooked with enough precision that people will argue for hours about whether medium-rare is perfection or if well-done should be classified as a crime.</p>
    <p>At its core, steak is a cut of beef (ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, T-bone, etc.), seasoned simply—usually just salt and pepper—then cooked hot and fast to lock in juices and create that golden-brown crust called the Maillard reaction (basically flavor alchemy).</p>
    <p>The beauty of steak is in its minimalism: meat, fire, and timing. Done right, it’s tender, juicy, and full of flavor. Done wrong, it’s shoe leather you could resole a boot with.</p>
    <p>Culturally, it’s loaded with symbolism—wealth, masculinity, indulgence, “treat yourself” energy. It can show up in a Michelin-star plate with red wine reduction or on a cheap backyard grill with nothing but a splash of beer to keep it moist.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (classic pan-seared steak):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 good cut of beef (ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, T-bone—whatever you can afford)</li>
        <li>Salt (coarse or flaky, not table dust)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (freshly cracked, otherwise don’t bother)</li>
        <li>Butter (a few knobs)</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves (smashed, skin on is fine)</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, or both)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for the pan)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the steak.</li>
        <p>– Take it out of the fridge 30–60 minutes before cooking (cold steak = uneven cook).</p>
        <p>– Pat it dry with paper towels.</p>
        <p>– Season aggressively with salt and pepper on both sides.</p>
        <li>Heat the pan.</li>
        <p>– Use a heavy pan (cast iron if you’ve got it).</p>
        <p>– Heat it until it’s almost smoking, then add a splash of olive oil.</p>
        <li>Sear.</li>
        <p>– Lay the steak in the pan and leave it alone for 2–3 minutes. Don’t poke, don’t move, don’t fidget.</p>
        <p>– Flip and sear the other side the same way.</p>
        <li>Butter baste.</li>
        <p>– Lower the heat slightly.</p>
        <p>– Add butter, garlic, and herbs to the pan.</p>
        <p>– Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steak repeatedly for flavor and moisture.</p>
        <li>Cook to temp.</li>
        <p>– Rare: 2–3 min per side</p>
        <p>– Medium-rare: 3–4 min per side</p>
        <p>– Medium: 4–5 min per side</p>
        <p>– Anything beyond that, you’re committing culinary violence, but technically it’s 6+ min per side.</p>
        <li>Rest.</li>
        <p>– Remove the steak from the pan and let it sit for 5–10 minutes before cutting. Juices need to redistribute or you’ll end up with beef soup on the cutting board.</p>
        <li>Serve.</li>
        <p>– Slice against the grain if it’s a big cut</p>
        <p>– Optional sprinkle of flaky salt.</p>
        <p>– That’s it—no sauce needed unless you messed up.</p>
    </ol>
