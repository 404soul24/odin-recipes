    <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>

    <p>Pizza is basically edible real estate: a flat piece of dough with a property development of sauce, cheese, and toppings. Born in Naples as street food for workers, it somehow mutated into a global obsession where every culture slaps its own personality on top—Americans drown it in cheese, Italians argue about simplicity, and the rest of the world experiments like it’s a science fair project.</p>
    <p>At its best, pizza is three things: a crisp yet chewy crust, tangy tomato sauce, and molten cheese that strings halfway across the room when you bite. From Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, basil) to monstrosities like barbecue chicken stuffed-crust, pizza’s versatility is its weapon. It can be a quick snack, a guilty pleasure, or an artisanal masterpiece baked in a 500°C wood-fired oven.</p>
    <p>It’s communal, it’s messy, and it’s scientifically engineered to make you forget your diet.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (basic Margherita level):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough (flour, water, yeast, salt, olive oil, maybe sugar if you’re cheating)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (canned tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, oregano, salt)</li>
        <li>Cheese (mozzarella is the classic, but people dump everything from cheddar to pineapple on there)</li>
        <li>Toppings (basil leaves if you want to feel Italian, pepperoni if you want to feel American, whatever’s in your fridge if you’re a student)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough (or buy it, I won’t judge).</li>
        <p>– Mix flour, water, yeast, salt, olive oil. Knead until smooth.</p>
        <p>– Let it rise for 1–2 hours until it doubles in size.</p>
        <li>Prep the sauce.</li>
        <p>– Heat olive oil, add garlic, dump in canned tomatoes, season with salt, oregano, maybe basil. Simmer until thick.</p>
        <li>Shape the base.</li>
        <p>– Flatten the dough into a circle (or square if you gave up). Don’t roll too thin unless you want cracker vibes.</p>
        <li>Assemble.</li>
        <p>– Spread sauce.</p>
        <p>– Add cheese.</p>
        <p>– Add toppings, but don’t bury it like a casserole—pizza is not lasagna.</p>
        <li>Bake.</li>
        <p>– Oven at max heat (250°C / 480°F if yours doesn’t suck).</p>
        <p>– Bake 7–12 minutes until the crust is browned and cheese bubbling.</p>
        <li>Finish.</li>
        <p>– Fresh basil, olive oil drizzle, done.</p>
        <p>– Eat recklessly, burn the roof of your mouth, complain, then keep eating.</p>
    </ol>
