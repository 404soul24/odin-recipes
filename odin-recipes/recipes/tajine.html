    <h1>Tajine Recipe</h1>
    <img src=" /img/tajine.jpg" alt="tajine" width="1500" height="1000">
    <p>A tajine isn’t just food, it’s Morocco’s national flex. At its core, it’s a slow-cooked stew made inside a clay pot with a pointy hat-shaped lid (also called a tajine—naming creativity was not the priority here). The lid traps steam, dripping it back down so the meat, vegetables, and spices basically marinate in their own glory for hours.</p>
    <p>Typical combos: lamb with prunes and almonds, chicken with preserved lemon and olives, or beef with potatoes and peas. Always spiced up with things like cumin, saffron, ginger, cinnamon, and fresh herbs. The result is tender meat that falls apart, sauce that begs for bread-dipping, and flavors that are savory, sweet, and aromatic all at once.</p>
    <p>It’s not fast food—it’s food that makes you wait, then rewards you for having patience.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Base stuff:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat (chicken, lamb, beef, or sometimes fish)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (potatoes, carrots, zucchini, peas, onions, tomatoes… depends on what you have)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (extra generous, this is Morocco after all)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Spices (the soul of the dish):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Saffron (if you’re not broke, otherwise turmeric fakes it fine)</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs like parsley and cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Special extras (optional but legendary):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preserved lemons (especially with chicken)</li>
        <li>Green or purple olives</li>
        <li>Dried fruits like prunes, apricots, or raisins (paired with lamb or beef)</li>
        <li>Nuts (almonds, sesame seeds, pine nuts for garnish)</li>
        <li>Honey (in sweet tajines)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the base.</li>
        <p>– Slice onions and spread them across the bottom of the tajine pot. They act like a mattress so the meat doesn’t burn.</p>
        <p>– Drizzle a heroic amount of olive oil.</p>
        <li>Season the meat.</li>
        <p>– Rub chicken, lamb, or beef with your spice mix (ginger, turmeric, paprika, cumin, pepper, saffron if you’re balling).</p>
        <p>– Place the meat right on top of the onions.</p>
        <li>Stack the vegetables.</li>
        <p>– Arrange carrots, potatoes, zucchini, or whatever you’re using around/over the meat in a little pyramid. This isn’t just aesthetic—veg at the top drip down flavor as they cook.</p>
        <li>Add extras.</li>
        <p>– Toss in preserved lemons, olives, prunes, apricots, or nuts depending on which tajine you’re aiming for.</p>
        <p>– Add a bit of water or broth—just enough so it doesn’t dry out (half a cup or less).</p>
        <li>Cook slow.</li>
        <p>– Cover with the tajine lid.</p>
        <p>– Put it on very low heat or in the oven. Tajines are patient; they need 1.5 to 2 hours minimum. No stirring. The steam cycles inside the cone lid and does the work for you.</p>
        <li>Finish.</li>
        <p>– Once the meat is tender and the sauce is reduced, garnish with fresh herbs or toasted nuts.</p>
        <p>– Bring the whole tajine pot to the table, no plating nonsense. Everyone digs in with bread.</p>
